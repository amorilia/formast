Todo
====

Short term
----------

* Refactor runtime and codegen tests so they share the same tests
  (with a different backend).

* Decide on names of AST nodes, e.g. replace 'top' by 'module' etc.

* Implement missing xml attributes (arg, template, maybe more).

* Refactor code to get rid of the formast/detail/ast.hpp include.

* Refactor expression parser into a separate cpp file.

* Complete documentation.

Long term
---------

* Implement a simple and wrappable runtime class system on top of
  formast.

* Discuss new language features.

* Discuss replacing xml by a domain specific language.
